## 📝 What is AgentUI?

AgentUI is a user interface framework designed for AI agents. It provides a set of 50 easy-to-use web components. These components follow Material Design 3 style, ensuring a clean and modern look. The framework also supports runtime introspection. This means it can adapt its interface based on the AI agent’s state or actions without extra setup.

AgentUI is built using current web standards such as custom elements and CSS3. It is zero-config. That means you do not need to adjust complicated settings to get started.

This repository offers tools for developers, but this guide helps you, as an end user, to download and run the software smoothly.
